~~See Pokus [homepage](http://139.59.169.28:8080) for a description of *what Pokus is*.~~

**Homepage currently unavailable (scroll down for app demo and description)**, it used to be hosted over at digitalocean before I understood the absurdity of hosting a static page on a droplet (lol).

I am, as of today (15th of May 2020), adding the homepage here so that potential employers can see that I've actually coded something. Even if it's a cast together prototype I did several years ago, I hope with this repo to showcase how far I've come in those years (honestly, it's a bloody mess opening this can of worms up, which is understandable â€“ it was my first React project, and I did it in under 4 days).

## TODO
[ ] React router, the currently hosted demo will be moved to /app, whereas the index will be the homepage.

[ ] Copy over the homepage from the old repo (possibly push the old repo just to underline how much simpler I've been able to do this today).

[ ] Maybe, if not doing a front-end for Matsmart is more fun, test out styled-systems here... It seems awfully enjoyable.

[ ] Possibly make this a full-fledged app, with node on the backend and showcase; SocketIO, authentication etc...

## [Demo](https://webel.github.io/Pokus)
See Pokus demo [here](https://webel.github.io/Pokus).

This demo is a simple react app that gives an idea of what the Pokus app connected to several devices would look like when used in an open office enviroment, or really any team enviroment where concentration is valued.

### Using the virtual Pokus device
**Start/Stop** the Pokus device by pressing the big gray button in the middle!

**Update timer** by clicking on the timer and entering the number of minutes you would like to focus. Pokus will automatically set your rest time to a fifth of your focus time - as recommended by the pomodoro technique. *Note* that the device can't be running to update the timer.

**See user panel** by dubbel-clicking anywhere on the background, the userpanel to the right of the device will become visible. On mobile, simply scroll past the virutal device to see the panel.

**See time left for user** by hovering over a users logo.
